## What is RAG

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Think of it like giving your AI a pice of information before it answers your question Instead of just using what the AI learned during training RAG lets it look up fresh information from databases or documents first. Then it combines that new info with its existing knowledge to give you a better answer Its basically like having a really smart assistant who checks their notes before responding to you

## Why is it used

Regular AI models can only use information they were trained on. This creates problems:

- They might give outdated information
- They sometimes make up facts that sound real but arent true
- They can't access new information that came out after training

RAG fixes these issues by letting AI systems pull current real information from external sources. This way the answers are more accurate and trustworthy. Companies use RAG because they want their AI to give correct up to date answers instead giving old information.

## How it works (retriever + generator)

Lets say you ask What are the latest features in GPT-5

**Retriever:**

- The system searches through ChatGPT, OpenAI documentation and recent articles
- Then it finds relevant chunks of text about GPT-5 features
- Then it will rank these chunks by how relevant they are to your question

**Generator:**

- Takes your original question Combines it with the retrieved information about GPT-5
- Then give answer that mixes the fact with an LLM style.

So instead of the AI guessing about GPT-5 features it actually looks up the real specs first then writes a proper response

## What is indexing

Before RAG can find anything it needs to organize all the information first this is called indexing.

Think of it like how Spotify organizes songs:

- Take millions of songs and break them into smaller categories (like artist, album, or genre).
- Create playlists, tags, and search options so you can quickly find the song you want.
- Store everything in a way that makes sense for fast searching

The indexing process usually involves:

- Splitting long documents into smaller pieces (like paragraphs, sections, or characters).
- Converting text into numbers that computers can understand and compare.
- Building a database that can be searched really fast. Here are some databases that are good at this Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, and many more.

Without good indexing your RAG system would be like trying to find a specific song in a messy library with no organization

## Why we perform chunking

Most documents are way too long to process all at once. AI models have limits on how much text they can handle in one go

Chunking breaks long documents into smaller manageable pieces.

- You can find the exact relevant section instead of sending a whole 50-page manual
- It fits within the AI models context window limits
- Processing smaller chunks is faster and cheaper
- You get more precise information

Think of it like listening to music you don't play the entire Spotify library you just pick the one song you want to hear.

## Why RAGs exist

Traditional AI models have some big limitations:

- They only know things up to when they were trained
- They sometimes confidently make up incorrect facts
- You can't verify from where information came

RAG systems solve these problems by:

- You always get the latest info.
- Answers are based on real sources.
- It can show where the info came from.
- Easy to keep updated just add new docs to your database.
