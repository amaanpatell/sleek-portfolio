## Overview

**NotebookLM AI Chatbot** is a knowledge-based AI assistant that allows users to chat with their own content.  
Users can upload **PDFs, YouTube videos, website URLs, and plain text**, and the system converts them into a searchable knowledge base.

The chatbot uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach to provide accurate, context-aware answers strictly based on the user’s uploaded data.

## Key Features

- **PDF Upload & Parsing**: Extract text from PDFs
- **YouTube Video Support**: Fetch and process video transcripts
- **Website & Blog Ingestion**: Crawl and extract readable content from URLs
- **Text Notes Support**: Add custom notes and documents
- **Vector Search**: Store embeddings for fast semantic retrieval
- **Context-Aware Chat**: Answers based only on user-provided sources
